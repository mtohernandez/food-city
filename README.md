# food-city
Food city is a context react app in real-time, you'll get the feeling that every action is responsive and simulates like the page is alive while ordering food, the animations are smooth.

I've tried to deploy the app on github pages but it does not seem to work, so I took the easy way of deploying it on firebase.
